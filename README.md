# 2048-AI
This is my final project for CPTR 430 where I tried to create an AI model that would play the game 2048. I did not create the code for the actual game and you can get the originial code here: https://data-flair.training/blogs/python-2048-game/
My first attempt was to create a reinforcment model using OpenAI gym and stable baselines 3. I built off of this youtube tutorial:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD6V3rcr_54&t=1323s. But ultimately I was unable to make that work.
My second attempt was to create a neural network model and I was successfully able to do that following along the tensorflow docuementation.
In the end my models were not able to reach above 256 but in the future I hope to continue to update this repo with improvments.
